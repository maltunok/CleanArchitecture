<br/>

This is a solution template for creating a Single Page App (SPA) with Angular and ASP.NET Core following the principles of Clean Architecture. Create a new project based on this template by clicking the above **Use this template** button or by installing and running the associated NuGet package (see Getting Started for full details). 

## Learn about Clean Architecture

## Technologies

* [ASP.NET Core 6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
* [Entity Framework Core 6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)
* [Angular 13](https://angular.io/)
* [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)
* [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/)
* [FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/)
* [NUnit](https://nunit.org/), [FluentAssertions](https://fluentassertions.com/), [Moq](https://github.com/moq) & [Respawn](https://github.com/jbogard/Respawn)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template) and run `dotnet new ca-sln`:

1. Install the latest [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
2. Install the latest [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Run `dotnet new --install Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template` to install the project template
4. Create a folder for your solution and cd into it (the template will use it as project name)
5. Run `dotnet new ca-sln` to create a new project
6. Navigate to `src/WebUI` and launch the project using `dotnet run`

Check out my [blog post](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/) for more information.

### Database Configuration

The template is configured to use an in-memory database by default. This ensures that all users will be able to run the solution without needing to set up additional infrastructure (e.g. SQL Server).

If you would like to use SQL Server, you will need to update **WebUI/appsettings.json** as follows:

```json
  "UseInMemoryDatabase": false,
```

Verify that the **DefaultConnection** connection string within **appsettings.json** points to a valid SQL Server instance. 

When you run the application the database will be automatically created (if necessary) and the latest migrations will be applied.

### Database Migrations

To use `dotnet-ef` for your migrations first ensure that "UseInMemoryDatabase" is disabled, as described within previous section.
Then, add the following flags to your command (values assume you are executing from repository root)

* `--project src/Infrastructure` (optional if in this folder)
* `--startup-project src/WebUI`
* `--output-dir Persistence/Migrations`

For example, to add a new migration from the root folder:

 `dotnet ef migrations add "SampleMigration" --project src\Infrastructure --startup-project src\WebUI --output-dir Persistence\Migrations`

## Overview

### Domain

This will contain all entities, enums, exceptions, interfaces, types and logic specific to the domain layer.

### Application

This layer contains all application logic. It is dependent on the domain layer, but has no dependencies on any other layer or project. This layer defines interfaces that are implemented by outside layers. For example, if the application need to access a notification service, a new interface would be added to application and an implementation would be created within infrastructure.

### Infrastructure

This layer contains classes for accessing external resources such as file systems, web services, smtp, and so on. These classes should be based on interfaces defined within the application layer.

### WebUI

This layer is a single page application based on Angular 13 and ASP.NET Core 6. This layer depends on both the Application and Infrastructure layers, however, the dependency on Infrastructure is only to support dependency injection. Therefore only *Startup.cs* should reference Infrastructure.
